# CyberMultiplier
## Readme!
### This mod was done entirely by me (fenicemaster) and was an idea requested by FruitCircuit

## Features
This is a mod that allows you to enlarge the CyberGrind!
You can go into the configs and change the size with the multiplier.

Here's a summary of the options:
* Multiplier (CyberGrind arena multiplier):
    * Allows the creation of more arenas. (called grids in the code)

* Start all at once (Start sync):
    * Once one arena gets activated all others activate automatically.

* Wait for others (Change sync):
    * Makes the arenas with no enemies wait for each of the others to have none.
       (This uses a timer so if the next waves don't immediately start wait for max 5 seconds)

* Manual counting (Screen cram):
    * Counts and substitutes the "enemies left" number, best useful when the previous setting is on.

### Be wary that i disabled "Change sync" because the CyberGrind wasn't made to have multiple arenas,
### So the staring of a wave could be very laggy but you might still want to start all of them at the start instead
### of going over each and all of them manually.

--Will need to add configgy support--
